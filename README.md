# Project Insights
- The boutique achieved a total sales value of $4.63M with 54K total orders, showing strong overall performance.
- The average rating of 2.97 indicates moderate satisfaction, signaling the need to improve product quality or service experience.
- Outerwear drives the highest sales, followed by Shoes and Dresses.
- Accessories and Tops contribute the least, indicating possible low demand or lack of product variety.
- Zara (660.78K), Mango (650.88K), and Banana Republic (615.75K) lead in sales. Gap (468.32K) is underperforming compared to other brands, signaling a need to revisit its product mix or promotions.

# Final Conclusion
The boutique is performing well in terms of sales volume and brand presence, but low customer ratings highlight an urgent need to improve customer experience. Focusing on quality improvements, brand-specific promotions, and boosting underperforming categories (Accessories, Tops, Gap products) can further enhance growth and satisfaction.
